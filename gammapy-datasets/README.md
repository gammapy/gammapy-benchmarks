# gammapy-data

Datasets used in tutorials and tests.

You may fetch this repo with `git`, though you may also download them as part of the Gammapy tutorials package with the command `gammapy download tutorials`, or independently of the tutorials package with `gammapy download datasets`.

Then you may set environment variable `$GAMMAPY_DATA` to the local folder where you have saved `gammapy-data`.
